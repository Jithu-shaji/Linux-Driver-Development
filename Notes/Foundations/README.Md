# Introduction to Linux Driver Development

Linux is a versatile and open-source operating system widely used for desktops, servers, and embedded devices. At its core, the Linux kernel manages hardware resources and provides essential services to applications. Understanding the distinction between user space and kernel space, as well as the role of device drivers and loadable kernel modules (LKMs), is fundamental for anyone aiming to develop or extend Linux device drivers.

This article covers the core concepts of Linux driver development, including the interaction between applications and hardware, the structure of kernel modules, and essential commands for working with LKMs.

## User Space

This is where normal applications run — for example, your C programs, Firefox, or VS Code. Applications in user space cannot directly access hardware such as the keyboard, GPU, or storage devices. Instead, they must request services from the kernel.

## Kernel Space

The kernel operates in a privileged mode with full access to the system’s hardware. It can directly interact with devices through registers, I/O ports, and memory-mapped I/O. However, errors in kernel space can be critical, potentially leading to a system crash (kernel panic).

## Device Drivers

Device drivers reside in kernel space. They act as the bridge between hardware and applications, allowing user-space programs to interact with devices safely and efficiently. Examples include drivers for keyboards, mice, GPUs, and network adapters.

## Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs)

A Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) is a separately compiled, object-oriented component of the Linux kernel that can be dynamically inserted into or removed from the kernel during system operation. LKMs are distributed as kernel object files (.ko), which contain code and metadata required for integration with the running kernel. In contrast to the statically linked kernel image (vmlinuz), LKMs enable extensibility and modularity by allowing additional functionality—such as device drivers, file systems, or networking protocols—to be incorporated without recompiling or rebooting the kernel.

An LKM provides:

* Initialization routine (`module_init`)
* Cleanup routine (`module_exit`)
* Metadata (e.g., license, author, description)

### Advantages of LKMs

**Modularity and Extensibility:** Functionality can be added or removed at runtime without recompiling the kernel, supporting separation of concerns.

**Resource Efficiency:** Only required modules are loaded, reducing memory footprint compared to a statically compiled kernel.

**Ease of Development and Maintenance:** Developers can test and debug kernel code incrementally. Prototyping device drivers or subsystems is simplified.

**Dynamic Adaptability:** New hardware or software functionality can be introduced at runtime. Unused modules can be unloaded, enhancing system flexibility.

**Fault Isolation:** Defective modules can be removed without rebuilding the kernel. While errors may still affect system stability, modularization allows controlled recovery.

# Linux Kernel Module Commands Reference

This is a quick reference for **commands used to work with Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs)** in Linux.

## 1. Load a Module

### `insmod`

```bash
sudo insmod <module_name>.ko [param=value ...]
```

* Loads a module into the running kernel.
* Example:

```bash
sudo insmod hello.ko
```

### `modprobe`

```bash
sudo modprobe <module_name> [param=value ...]
```

* Loads a module and **resolves dependencies automatically**.
* Example:

```bash
sudo modprobe hello
```

## 2. Remove a Module

### `rmmod`

```bash
sudo rmmod <module_name>
```

* Removes a module.
* Fails if dependent modules exist.

### `modprobe -r`

```bash
sudo modprobe -r <module_name>
```

* Removes a module and **automatically removes dependent modules**.

## 3. List Loaded Modules

### `lsmod`

```bash
lsmod
```

* Shows all currently loaded modules.
* Columns:

    * `Module` → module name
    * `Size` → memory used
    * `Used by` → dependent modules count

## 4. View Module Information

### `modinfo`

```bash
modinfo <module_name>.ko
```

* Displays module metadata: author, license, description, version, parameters, dependencies.

## 5. Kernel Logging and Debugging

### `dmesg`

```bash
dmesg | tail
```

* Prints kernel messages including `printk` output from modules.

### Monitor kernel logs continuously

```bash
tail -f /var/log/kern.log
```

## 6. Module Parameters

* Declared in module code using `module_param()`:

```c
static int myint = 0;
module_param(myint, int, 0660);
```

* Passed during insertion:

```bash
sudo insmod mymodule.ko myint=42
```
