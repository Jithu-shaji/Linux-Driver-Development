# Linux-Driver-Development

This repository is meant to log my journey through the world of Linux device drivers. 
If it matures enough, it may also serve as a resource for others who are starting their journey, just like I did. 

## Goals
- Document my learning process step by step.
- Share practical examples of Linux driver code.
- Explore kernel internals relevant to driver development.
- Build a reference for beginners in Linux driver programming.
